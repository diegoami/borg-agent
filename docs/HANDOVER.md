# Handover

The newest entry is first. Each session adds one entry at the end of its
work and updates "Current state".

## Current state

- Nothing is built yet. The next task is **T01** (PLAN.md); T02 and T07 can
  run in parallel with it.
- Open owner questions: none.

## 2026-11-08: repository initialized

Set up from the owner's local session, which also runs the Borg zoo.

What exists:
- the requirements, with the owner's five decisions accepted;
- the plan for milestone 1, rules, sources policy and pins;
- the setup script, a Python package skeleton, the repository tests and CI.

Facts the next sessions will need:
- **Pins** are in `pins.json`. The C game and Borg are better-borg-c
  milestone 6 (`b3c825c9`, tag `4.2.6-impact-v6`), the zoo's
  `4.2.6-bbc-m6`. The zoo builds and plays every C specimen with
  `tools/measure-native.py` at better-borg-c `fc9d97cb`; read it before T01.
  It extracts the tree with `git archive`, instruments it by text
  replacement (`native-observer.c`, hooks in `main-test.c`, `game-world.c`,
  `ui-game.c`, `borg/borg.c` and `borg/borg-io.c`), builds with CMake and
  plays through the test frontend, whose input is a script of `key` lines.
- **Turns.** The zoo's caps count the C game's `turn`. At normal speed one
  player turn is 10 game turns, so a 100,000-turn cap is about 10,000 player
  turns.
- **The Borg's connection** (R1): it acts through `inkey_hack` (set in
  `src/borg/borg.c`), and reads the player's map knowledge in
  `borg-update.c`, the screen and messages in `borg-io.c` and
  `borg-messages.c`, and the character in `borg-trait.c`.
- **First post-mortem cases** (T08): the zoo's `classes-m6` run (results
  branch of diegoami/borg-zoo, `results/classes-m6/42489102169-1/cells.jsonl`)
  has `4.2.6-bbc-m6` dying to "a floating eye" on seed 1865911738
  (Half-Troll Mage) and seed 1375157069 (Dunadan Priest). The same lead came
  from Mandos on the Neo engine: floating eyes killed 4 of 13 characters in
  the zoo's `mandos-classes-18`.
- **Class matters most** early on: on the zoo's `classes-1800` suite the
  original Borg loses about 70% of Druids and about 19% of Paladins by turn
  100,000. The owner wants strategy by class in the remake.

Left for the owner:
- T09 needs model access: the owner's machine, or a cloud environment with
  `BORG_AGENT_BASE_URL`, `BORG_AGENT_API_KEY` and `BORG_AGENT_MODEL` set.
- Reviews by a different model family are arranged by the owner.
